!!!!WARNING!!!!
This is old build of The Slayer Engine.
If you want to use 4k via DSR you need to manually change your resolution.

Set the game to window mode if you have any problem:
-Go to "Engine" folder;
-Open Default_pc.cfg;
-Add fullscreen = 0 (if you already have it then just change it to 0);
