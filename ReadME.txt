Latest patch inludes:
- Debug windows:
  Console [Num0];
  OctTree [Num1];
  TStaticManager [Num2];
[Pay attention: OctTree and TStaticManager don't work in main menu]
[Copy only 'GettingUp.exe' to the bin folder if you don't want to use other features]  

- Fixed resolution menu code;
- Widescreen support [1280x720 - 1600x900 - 1920x1080 - 3840x2160] [WIP];

!!!!WARNING!!!!
This is and old build of The Slayer Engine.
If you want to use 4k via DSR you need to manually change your resolution.

Set the game to window mode if you have any problem:
-Go to "Engine" folder;
-Open Default_pc.cfg;
-Add fullscreen = 0 (if you already have it then just change it to 0);

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The NUMs were used as the hotkeys because of 2 things: 
They can be locked/unlocked by NumLock and they're overlay friendly in the most cases. 
So if you can't see any debug window -> NumLock is what you need to press.
